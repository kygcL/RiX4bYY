## NepLoom Project Journal

### 17th June, 2025

The journey began today. I learned about the Summer Hack Club event and spent the day exploring ideas. The concept for NepLoom was bornâ€”a platform to revolutionize global education by making it free, engaging, and accessible to everyone. The vision is to create a space where learning isn't a chore but an adventure.

The idea is now taking shape. I started coding today, setting up the basic project structure. The initial focus was on the core architecture, including the `usePipeline` hook, which will be crucial for our interactive features. I also began sketching out the landing page in Figma, aiming for a design that is both beautiful and intuitive.

Woke up this morning with a clear goal: complete the landing page and implement the authentication system. These are the gateways to the NepLoom experience, and getting them right is essential. The plan is to create a seamless and secure entry point for our future users. The day is young, and the motivation is high. Let's get to it.

Planned to add some hooks to the app and started planning the models for NepLoom. However, I became very busy with household responsibilities today, so only some of the hooks were partially completed. Progress was slower than expected, but the vision remains strong. Also, the FIX IT challenge from HackaTime kept me busy building a script to make blogging website navigation easier. This side project took up a good portion of the day, but it was a valuable learning experience and could inspire future features for NepLoom.

Today, I added the UI and UX for the authentication page, incorporating both login and register options. The design features a space-like aesthetic that aligns perfectly with the NepLoom theme. This interface captures the cosmic, exploratory spirit of our platform while ensuring clean usability. This marks a significant step forward in creating the user onboarding experience, welcoming learners into their educational journey through the cosmos of knowledge.

Added the Navbar, dark mode compatibility for the App, theme toggler button, context menu for searching and navigating app. Today was focused on creating a seamless navigation experience with a beautiful command menu that supports VS Code-like search features including direct path navigation (> or goto:). The navbar now features a glassy, space-themed aesthetic that perfectly complements our cosmic design language, while the theme toggler ensures accessibility across different lighting conditions.

Aim at building the authentication system for NepLoom and also determining the models for the supabase table for Loomers, Loom, Galaxy and Nebula table. Today's focus is on laying the foundation for user management and content organization. The authentication system will be the gateway for learners to access their personalized cosmic journey, while the database models will define how knowledge is structured within our educational universe. The Loomers table will manage user profiles, Loom will contain individual learning units, Galaxy will group related content, and Nebula will represent broader subject areas - creating a hierarchical knowledge structure that mirrors the vastness of space.
